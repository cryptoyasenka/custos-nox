## Pinned intro thread (post as a thread at account creation)

**Tweet 1 (main, standalone):**
```
Custos Nox — an open-source Solana multisig monitor that would have caught the Drift config drift before $285M was drained.

Building for the @colosseum Frontier Hackathon 🛡️

Here's what it does:
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
Five detectors live on devnet:

• TimelockRemovalDetector — fires when governance timelock drops to zero
• MultisigWeakeningDetector — fires when Squads signer threshold is reduced (e.g. 5-of-7 → 1-of-7)
• PrivilegedNonceDetector — fires when a nonce account is initialized or authority rotated
• StaleNonceExecutionDetector — fires when a pre-signed durable nonce executes hours after seeding
• SignerSetChangeDetector — fires when a Squads multisig's members vector is mutated (signer rotation/eviction)

Four map to each step of the April 2026 Drift attack chain. The fifth catches signer-set rotation — an adjacent vector that's hit other Solana protocols.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Why it matters:

The Drift exploit didn't happen in one tx. It was set up over days — timelock removed, threshold weakened, nonce prepped.

All on-chain. All public. Nobody was watching.

Custos Nox watches. Sub-second alerts to Discord or Slack.
