## A5 — Project name + tagline

**Name (already set):** Custos Nox

**Tagline options (pick one — ~10 words):**

> Option A (incident-focused):
> "Real-time on-chain monitor that catches Drift-class attacks"

> Option B (audience-focused):
> "Open-source attack detection for Solana multisigs and DAOs"

> Option C (action-focused):
> "Alerts you before the governance vote to drain your treasury"

**Recommendation:** Option B — clearest for judges who scan 300 projects.

## A7 — Long description / writeup

### Problem

In April 2026, Drift Protocol lost $285M to an attack that spent days setting
up on-chain before executing. Three governance config changes (timelock removal,
multisig weakening, privileged-nonce creation) happened in full public view —
but no tool alerted anyone.

Solana Foundation's STRIDE monitoring program targets protocols with $10M+ TVL.
The other 99% — small DAOs, grant committees, treasury multisigs — have nothing.

### Solution

Custos Nox is an open-source daemon that watches Solana accounts over WebSocket
and fires alerts the moment a config change matches a known attack pattern.

Three detectors run live today:

- **TimelockRemovalDetector** — fires when a governance timelock drops to zero
  or below half (Squads v4 + SPL Governance programs).
- **MultisigWeakeningDetector** — fires when a Squads v4 signer threshold is
  reduced (e.g. 5-of-7 → 1-of-7).
- **PrivilegedNonceDetector** — fires when a watched System Program nonce
  account is initialized or has its authority rotated.

Each detector maps directly to one step in the Drift April 2026 attack chain.
Any single alert would have bought hours of response time.

### Architecture highlights

- TypeScript daemon, zero Rust, pure npm — contributors don't need a Solana
  dev environment to build or test.
- WebSocket with exponential backoff (1s → 60s) and 30-second slot health checks.
- Alert fan-out to Discord webhooks, Slack webhooks, and stdout — all sinks
  receive every alert; one failing sink doesn't block the others.
- Per-detector 5s timeout: a hanging detector surfaces a low-severity operational
  alert instead of silently blocking the pipeline.
- 135 unit + integration tests; GitHub Actions CI on every push.

### Demo

A devnet smoke harness (`scripts/`) reproduces all three Drift attack-chain steps
end-to-end. Each script fires a real on-chain transaction; the daemon prints the
corresponding alert within seconds.

### What's next (roadmap)

- **StaleNonceExecutionDetector** (v0.2) — fires when a pre-signed transaction
  older than N hours executes from a durable nonce. Requires transaction-log
  ingestion.
- API mode and hosted alert feed for teams that can't self-host.

## A8 — Track selection

**Primary track (Build Path):** Treasury / Security

**Secondary track (if allowed):** Governance (DAOs) / Public Goods

**Rationale:**
- Custos Nox protects treasury multisigs → Treasury
- It's a security detection tool → Security
- It's MIT-licensed open-source infra for the whole ecosystem → Public Goods

**Note:** Exact track names visible only after login to Arena form. Match closest
to "Security", "DeFi Infrastructure", "Public Goods" if those are the options.
If only one track allowed, choose **Security / DeFi Infrastructure**.
