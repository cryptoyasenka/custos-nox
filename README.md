# Custos Nox

[![ci](https://github.com/cryptoyasenka/custos-nox/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cryptoyasenka/custos-nox/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Open-source real-time monitor for Solana multisigs and DAOs. Detects the
attack chain that drained $285M from Drift on April 1, 2026.

**Live:** <https://custos-nox-production.up.railway.app>

**Dashboard:** marketing site, detector catalog, and sample event feed
live in [`dashboard/`](./dashboard) (Next.js 16, static build).

## What it catches

Four detectors run live today, covering all on-chain steps of the Drift
April 2026 attack chain:

- **TimelockRemovalDetector** — alerts when a governance timelock is
  removed or dropped below half (Squads v4 + SPL Governance).
- **MultisigWeakeningDetector** — alerts on signer threshold reductions
  (e.g. 5-of-7 → 1-of-7) on Squads v4 multisigs.
- **PrivilegedNonceDetector** — alerts when a watched System Program
  nonce account is initialized or has its authority rotated.
- **StaleNonceExecutionDetector** — alerts when a durable nonce is
  advanced (a pre-signed transaction executes) significantly after the
  nonce was first initialized. Fires when the gap exceeds a configurable
  threshold (default 1 hour).

Alerts fan out to Discord, Slack, and CLI. Every configured sink
receives every alert; webhook failures are logged but do not block
other sinks. Detectors that throw or hang are surfaced as low-severity
operational alerts rather than disappearing into stderr.

## How this catches the Drift attack chain

The April 2026 Drift exploit chained three on-chain config changes and
one pre-signed execution. Custos Nox's detectors map directly to those
steps:

| Attack step                                         | Detector                       | Severity |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- |
| Realm timelock reduced from 6 days → 0             | `spl-governance-timelock-removal` | critical |
| Squads threshold dropped from 5-of-9 → 1-of-9      | `squads-multisig-weakening`    | high     |
| Durable nonce created under attacker-controlled key | `privileged-nonce`             | critical |
| Pre-signed withdrawal tx executed from stale nonce  | `stale-nonce-execution`        | high     |

Any single detector firing would have bought hours of response time.
Custos Nox catches all four steps of the attack chain.

## Positioning

Solana Foundation's STRIDE program funds commercial monitoring for
protocols with $10M+ TVL. Custos Nox is for the 99% below that line —
small DAOs, grant committees, treasury multisigs, solo-builder
wallets. Self-host in five minutes. MIT licensed.

## Reliability

- WebSocket supervisor reconnects with exponential backoff (1s → 60s)
  after connection drops or a failed 30s slot health check.
- Baseline account state is fetched before subscribing, so the first
  change after startup is always diffed correctly (web3.js
  `onAccountChange` does not deliver the initial snapshot).
- SIGINT/SIGTERM trigger a graceful shutdown that drains in-flight
  dispatches before exiting.
- Per-detector 5s timeout; timeouts and throws emit a low-severity
  alert rather than silently disappearing.

## Status

Pre-release. Built for the Solana Frontier Hackathon
(submission 2026-05-10 23:59 PDT). All four detectors are running live;
devnet smoke harness in `scripts/` reproduces three steps end-to-end
on-chain (timelock removal, multisig weakening, privileged-nonce init).
The stale-nonce detector activates after the PrivilegedNonce init step —
the same account is watched by both detectors simultaneously.

## Quick start

See [DEV-ENV-SETUP.md](./DEV-ENV-SETUP.md).

## Running the devnet demo

End-to-end proof that Custos Nox catches real on-chain config changes.
You need a funded devnet keypair at `~/.config/solana/id.json`
(or set `SOLANA_KEYPAIR` to its path). `scripts/devnet-create.ts` will
request a 1 SOL airdrop if your balance is below 0.5 SOL.

The demo walks through three steps of the Drift attack chain, each
firing a distinct detector:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm install

# Terminal 1 — create a 3-of-5 Squads multisig on devnet with a 1-day
# time_lock. Copy the printed MULTISIG PDA.
npm run smoke:create

# Generate a fresh Keypair for the privileged-nonce step. This prints
# the pubkey to add to CUSTOS_WATCH. The account does not exist on
# chain yet — we wire it into the daemon BEFORE it gets initialized.
npm run smoke:nonce-plan

# Edit .env and set CUSTOS_WATCH to both the MULTISIG PDA and the
# nonce pubkey (comma-separated, each as program:account).

# Terminal 2 — start the daemon.
npm run dev

# Terminal 1 — simulate the Drift attack chain, one step at a time.
# Each command triggers an alert in Terminal 2.
npm run smoke:timelock  -- <MULTISIG_PDA>   # CRITICAL: timelock removed
npm run smoke:weaken    -- <MULTISIG_PDA>   # HIGH:     3-of-5 → 1-of-5
npm run smoke:nonce-init                    # CRITICAL: nonce initialized
```

Within a few seconds of each config transaction confirming, the daemon
in Terminal 2 prints one alert per step — the same three detectors
that would catch the real Drift exploit on mainnet.

### Verifying your RPC before recording the demo

The nonce step relies on the RPC delivering an `onAccountChange`
notification when the watched pubkey transitions from "does not exist"
to "initialized". Providers differ; run the diagnostic once before
recording to confirm yours does:

```bash
npm run check:null-subscribe
```

Exit 0 means the detector will fire on `smoke:nonce-init`. Exit 1
means the provider silently drops null-baseline notifications — switch
to a provider that honors them, or fall back to polling.

## Self-host with Docker

```bash
docker build -t custos .
docker run -d --name custos --restart unless-stopped --env-file .env custos
docker logs -f custos
```

The image runs as the built-in unprivileged `node` user and reads the
same `CUSTOS_*` env vars documented in `.env.example`.
