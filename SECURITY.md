# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Custos Nox is pre-release (`v0.3`). Security fixes are applied to the latest commit on `main`.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability in Custos Nox itself (not the protocols it monitors),
please **do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Email: **cryptoyasenka@gmail.com**

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact

You will receive a response within 48 hours. Critical issues are patched within 7 days.

## What Custos Nox does NOT do

- It does not hold private keys or sign transactions
- It does not have write access to any on-chain accounts
- It is read-only: it subscribes to account changes via WebSocket RPC
- Alerts go to webhooks you configure — Custos Nox has no access to your Discord/Slack
  except through the webhook URL you provide in your `.env`

## Secrets in `.env`

Your `.env` file contains:
- `CUSTOS_RPC_URL` — your Helius (or other) RPC endpoint with API key
- `CUSTOS_DISCORD_WEBHOOK` / `CUSTOS_SLACK_WEBHOOK` — webhook URLs

These are never logged or transmitted anywhere except to the configured sinks.
The `.env` file is in `.gitignore`. Never commit it.

The startup log line prints only the RPC host (e.g. `mainnet.helius-rpc.com`),
never the full URL with the API key in the path or query string. See
`redactRpcUrl` in `src/daemon.ts`.

## Threat model

Custos Nox is a passive observer. It reads account state from an RPC node and
fires alerts. The attack surface is:

1. **RPC endpoint compromise** — if your Helius API key is leaked, an attacker can
   read the same on-chain data Custos Nox reads. There is no additional risk beyond
   what the RPC key already provides.

2. **Webhook URL leakage** — if your Discord/Slack webhook URL is leaked, an attacker
   can send fake alerts to your channel. Custos Nox does not authenticate outbound
   webhooks. Treat webhook URLs as secrets.

3. **Supply chain** — dependencies are pinned via `package-lock.json`. Run
   `npm audit` before deploying in production.
